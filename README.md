## Features
- __Certificate Logs:__ finding those who willing to create public ssl / tls certificates without understanding the consequences
- __Multiple output formats:__ STIX, Snort, Suricata, PAN, Syslog, Twitter, etc...
- __very cute:__ all about the fail train!


## TODO
* Add additional techniques from Red Team playbooks and IR playbooks on the funny ways hackers, crackers, and red teamers have been caught
* Add Docker files
* Add Vagrant files
* Add Chef files

## Usage
```bash
python pooropssec.py
```

## Philosophy
Organizations may improve their information security posture by rethinking it
 from the perspective of an attacker trying to gain access to their most 
 critical assets (data, people and systems).  Typically this is accomplished with 
  experience from the front lines to simulate the tools, tactices, and procedures (TTPs)
  of real hackers and crackers.  However, everyone makes mistakes.  Or Red Teams are one trick 
  ponies who only know how to perform two to three different techniques. Then it is VERY easy for a Red Teamer
  to fall into practicing poor operational security behaviors.  We take advantage of these lazy behaviors, TTPs, and 
  related business operating expense saving techniques.  In short, anything to move higher up the KillChain to 
  reduce the time to respond to events and incidents before they happen is a ++ .  We are faced with excessive amounts of data, of various noise to signal ratios, where questions
  and answers are easily hidden.  But available to those who know how to ask the right questions and dig deep.
  
  
  * Mature beyond the traditional hunting methods - WHOIS and name server monitoring, passive DNS, Malware / Implant tracking, Honeypots, etc...
  * Enhance your security team's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to real-world incidents
  * Identify and mitigate complex security vulnerabilities before an attack exploits them
  * Still able to create diamond models to quickly pivot to patient zero and hero
  * To cause pain and suffering for those who do not follow proper operational security, IE https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/Red-Team-Infrastructure-Wiki
  
  Deceptive tradecraft should be fun and light, not stern and stressful.  It is cool to be cute.
